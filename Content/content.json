It is also a fairly basic game in terms of the rules and code complexity. Overall, it was a very fun project and it did teach me a good amount in creating efficient algorithms through the clear empty tiles algorithm.",

With this project I wanted to learn more about JavaScript graphics so the entire game is made using the canvas tag, and I also wanted to learn more about objects/object-oriented programming within JavaScript so I made sure that the snake and apples were objects that had their own properties and methods.",

A few things to know about me are I am a crazy sports fan (football specifically, go Patriots!) and in my other free time I enjoy staying fit and watching anime. Web development has been particularly interesting to me and I am interested in going down the full-stack developer route. I will say I do however enjoy the front end style of web development a bit more as styling the website and making it look nice is what makes web development fun to me.",
